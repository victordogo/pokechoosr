The goal of pokechoosr is to provide a fun and (almost) statistical way to choose your teams in the mainline Pokemon games based on each pokemon's stats. A detailed description of how this is done can be seen in the package's vignettes. This package does not support decision based on trainers/gym leaders present in each game (yet)!
